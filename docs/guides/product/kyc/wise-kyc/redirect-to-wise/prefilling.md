Prefilling
Copy

Make onboarding new users easier by sending portion of required customer data upfront via API.

Our partner integrations require customers to become Wise users in the process of connecting their account to Wise. This is an initial one time setup during which customers enter their personal and business details, which is a manual process. Integrating partners might also have collected some or all onboarding data required by Wise. The Onboarding API is designed to speed up customer onboarding onto Wise, by leveraging the data that integrating partners have already collected from them. This results in an onboarding experience where customers only need to review a series of pre-filling forms instead of filling them in from scratch.
