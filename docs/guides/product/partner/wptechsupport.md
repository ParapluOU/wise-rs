Wise Platform Technical Integration Support
Copy

As a Wise Platform partner, for any technical issues you may experience with the Wise API once your integration is live, you have access to a global technical support team who are available both during business hours for general requests, and 24/7 for emergencies. We’re there to support you with issues directly related to your technical integration, including unhandled API errors, failures in user flows, and issues with webhooks. You can also reach us for general technical queries and support with our API documentation.

General Technical Support

During the business week, the fastest and most effective way to contact the support team is by email to api@wise.com. We continuously monitor our inboxes from Monday to Friday. So that we can help you quickly, it’s important to provide as much information up front as possible. Where applicable, please include in your request:

API endpoint(s) affected.
Business impact of errors.
x-trace-id examples of failing requests.
The environment: production or sandbox.
API request and response body.
Timestamps, and duration of issues.
User or profile IDs if applicable.
Response times

We often need to ask for more information after you have contacted us, and while we are working on a solution.

If our team replies to your request, your case is held open for 72 hours. If we don't hear back in that time, we have to close the case. But don't worry, you can re-open the request if you are still having issues.

How We Classify Requests

The team will adhere to the response and resolution times set out in your commercial agreements with Wise Platform, though we make every effort to handle all incoming cases as soon as we can, according to the severity of your issue.

Severity 1 describes an incident that disables major functionality of your integration, or results in a full service outage.

Severity 2 describes an incident that impacts some functionality for users, or major functions where a workaround exists.

Severity 3 describes isolated or minor errors that don’t significantly affect integration functionality, but still interrupt normal technical operations.

All new emails to api@wise.com are handled initially as severity 3 until assessed by the team; you can also expect general questions around the API and documentation to be handled within this criteria.

Wise Public Status Page

We report incidents and maintenance notifications to Wise's Public Status Page. We recommend that you subscribe to the page: you can do this by email, Slack, or webhook. You also have the option to integrate with the status page over API.

Emergency Support

We recognise that some requests to the team require an urgent response, such as critical outages or interruptions to service. To support you in these events, we offer an enhanced support solution.

You should only follow the Emergency Support process in the event of a total integration outage or a similar high-severity issue that requires immediate attention outside of our normal working hours. Examples of high-severity issues include:

Complete payment processing outages affecting all users.
Critical system failures preventing any form of integration functionality.
Major security incidents needing urgent resolution.

If you think you need to escalate a critical issue by phone, please check the Wise Status Page first. If an incident has been reported there, the on-call team will be unable to provide you with more detailed updates.

General (non-technical or non-critical) support requests made to the emergency channels may be redirected to our standard support channels, which could result in delays and affect our ability to respond to the most severe incidents. Frequent misuse can result in restrictions on these enhanced escalation methods.
By Email

In the event of a “Severity 1” outage please include the words “urgent” or “critical” in the subject line of your email: this will create an alert for an on-call engineer 24/7 to ensure you receive a rapid support response from the team.

By Phone

We also offer high-severity incident notification by phone, to an emergency phone number monitored 24/7 by our team. Your CSM will be able to provide this.

When you call the emergency number, you’ll hear an automated greeting informing you that you’ve reached Wise Platform on-call. You’ll then be connected directly to an engineer in the team.

In the case that you’re not successfully connected to an engineer, there are three levels of fallback - meaning we’ll try to connect you to one of another two engineers in the team. This could happen in the unlikely event of a major outage across the API, and many Wise Platform partners are attempting to contact the team at the same time.

As a final means of reaching the team in the event no engineers are currently available, you’ll be prompted to leave a voicemail which the team will receive. When you leave a voicemail, please advise the team how to follow up with you - either providing an email address or phone number.

When you do reach an engineer, they will:

Capture basic information about your integration and the issue.
Ensure an incident is raised internally and mobilise the appropriate teams.
Follow up with you to coordinate further steps over email - we’ll ask you to email api@wise.com as well with more information (for example trace ids) so we can work with you on resolving the issue. Note: The purpose of the phone number is to alert us to critical issues, we won’t keep you on the line while we troubleshoot (though will set up a Zoom call over email if it’s needed).

We ask that you only use the phone number to report issues in the first instance; we’ll provide updates over email to api@wise.com and via the Wise Public Status Page; the team are unable to provide updates over phone for ongoing incidents.

The technical support team is committed to providing the highest quality of service in the event you need urgent support from Wise.
