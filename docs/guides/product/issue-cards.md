Card Issuance
Copy

Learn how to issue cards for your customers

Wise's Card Issuance allows you to issue both physical and virtual cards to your users, along with a full suite of card management tools such as spending controls and limits.

Architecture

A key thing about Wise's Card Issuance is that all Wise cards are linked to a Wise Multi-Currency Account (MCA). An MCA provides multiple balances in different currencies (i.e USD, SGD, EUR) for the card.

Authentication

Depending on your partner model, the authentication model will vary. Please see our connection guides to see which is applicable to your integration
