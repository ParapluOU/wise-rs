Manual Provisioning

Users are able to add virtual and physical cards to Apple Pay and Google Pay.

They can enter the card details into the wallet app and Wise will send a one time passcode to the phone number

For partners onboarded after 1/3/2025, we will use the registered phone number from the profile, which we will obtain through the create profile endpoint or update profile endpoint.

For partners onboarded before 1/3/2025, the phone number on the card will be used until you have been moved over to use the profile phone number by our support team

No code is required to implement manual provisioning.

Push Provisioning

Push provisioning allows your cardholders to add their virtual and physical cards to their digital wallets by using your app. The process allows customers to avoid entering their card data and allows to skip additional verification steps.

Wise offers APIs that allow partners to implement push provisioning within their own mobile apps.
