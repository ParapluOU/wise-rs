Issuance of Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRCs) for INR payments

For INR transfers where either the sender or recipient is a business, the recipient may request a Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC) as evidence of the foreign transfer to India.

If the recipient asks for an FIRC, you can provide a Non Objection Certificate (NOC) generated by Wise, which they can present to the payout bank to obtain the FIRC.

The documents/noc endpoint allows you to download a non objection certificate.
