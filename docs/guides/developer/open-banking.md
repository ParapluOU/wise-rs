Open Banking
Copy

Faster payments with seamless bank account connections

The Wise Open Banking API is aimed for Financially Regulated Third Party Providers who can prove their regulatory status either by being a member of the Open Banking Directory or possessing an eIDAS Certificate. Third Parties or individuals who do not meet these requirements are welcome to check out our Public API.

The Wise Open Banking API is a collection of RESTful APIs that enable Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access account information, initiate payments and confirm availability of funds on behalf of Wise customers. The API implementation follows the Open Banking UK standard, and Wise is a registered member of the Open Banking Directory.

Through this API you can:

Query account information if you're an Account Information Service Provider (AISP).
Initiate payments and/or confirm the availability of funds if you're a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP).

We currently support version 3.1.11 of the Open Banking API.

Contingency Mechanism

We offer our bespoke Connected Applications API as a secondary API, acting as a contingency mechanism. The Connected Applications API provide the same set of functionality for both AISPs and PISPs as our Open Banking API does. In order to avoid any delays in switching over to the contingency mechanism during a major outage of the Open Banking API, we encourage TPPs to preemptively seek out registration to our contingency mechanism by reaching out to openbanking@wise.com and specifically requesting access to the contingency mechanism.

Prerequisites

There's a couple of things you should be aware of in order to connect to the Wise Open Banking API:

Being a registered TPP under the Open Banking Directory will ease the integration process.
We are using mutualTLS as the means for authentication. Moreover, the CN of your client certificate is expected to match the clientId under which you are registered.
You need to register your client, before you'll be able to call any of the APIs. Check out the Sandbox Access first.

For a detailed description of requirements and supported algorithms please check out the Well-Known Open Banking URL.

Well-Known Open Banking URL in Sandbox

https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/openbanking/.well-known/openid-configuration

Well-Known Open Banking URL in Production

https://wise.com/openbanking/.well-known/openid-configuration

Dynamic Client Registration

If you're a registered TPP at the Open Banking Directory you can simply use our Dynamic Client Registration endpoint to self-onboard your organization using the Software Statement Assertion issued by the Open Banking Directory.

Confirmation of Payee clients

In case you're looking to onboard a Confirmation of Payee (CoP) client please make sure to include the cop scope into the list of requests scopes. The list of requested scopes should be:

"scope": "openid openbanking payments cop"

Sandbox Access

We highly recommend that you get started with connecting to our sandbox first, before moving on to production. To get started with the registration process drop us an email to openbanking@wise.com.

Open Banking Directory

If you're a registered TPP in the Open Banking Directory you will probably be using a Signing and a Transport certificates issued by Open Banking. The accepted Open Banking certificates are the eIDAS-like OBWAC and OBSeal certificates.

Legacy Open Banking Transport and Signing certificates are no longer supported after 30 June 2021.

You can easily onboard by providing a Software Statement Assertion (SSA) generated in the Open Banking Directory.

Please make sure to have your list of Redirect Uri-s correctly configured in your Software Statement, otherwise you'll not be able to go through the whole flow.

eIDAS Certificates

In case you're using an eIDAS certificates instead of the ones issued by the Open Banking Directory just contact us at openbanking@wise.com to see how we can move forward.

Sandbox Test User

You can sign up for a test user account here https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/register. The 2FA code used for any subsequent logins to the sandbox will alway be 111111.

You'll be asked to set up a developer account by filling in your profile information. Once this is done, you'll see that your newly created profile comes with a couple of test accounts opened and some test funds in them.

You do NOT need to create an API Token via the web interface in case your intention is to use this test user for the Open Banking flow.

Sandbox Test Flow

After you've successfully applied for the Sandbox Access and you've set up a Sandbox Test User you are ready to test the Open Banking flow. For the purpose of this test flow let's assume that your TPP is an AISP and it's registered with the following details

Client ID	Redirect URI	Authorized Scopes
ob-dummy-tpp	https://ob-dummy-tpp/redirect	accounts
1. Create an Access Token

As a first step you'll need to request an access token from the Token Endpoint.

Request

POST https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token

Field	Description	Format
grant_type	OAuth Grant Type	client_credentials
scope	The requested scopes	Space separated list
client_id	The client ID in accordance with RFC8705	Text

You must include the requested scope in your token request. As an AISP your requested scope will be accounts.

Response
Field	Description	Format
access_token	The access token	Text
expires_in	Access Token expiration time in seconds	Long
expires_at	Access Token expiration timestamp (UTC)	Text
scope	The scopes you have been given access to	Text
Example Token Request
curl -X POST \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounts&client_id=ob-dummy-tpp'
Example Token Response
{
    "access_token": "abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-abcdef123456",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 6000,
    "scope": "accounts openbanking"
}
2. Create a Consent

POST https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/account-access-consents

Using the access-token returned from Creating an Access Token you can create a new consent object. Use the authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx

The payload of this request will look different depending on whether you're an AISP, PISP or CBPII. For an AISP you'll need to specify a set of permissions describing the access that you wish to gain on behalf of the end user.

Permissions

For AISPs the list of supported permissions is:

ReadAccountsBasic
ReadAccountsDetail
ReadBalances
ReadTransactionsBasic
ReadTransactionsCredits
ReadTransactionsDebits
ReadTransactionsDetail
ReadDirectDebits
Response

The response will be JSON data reflecting the newly created consent object. There are two important return values to highlight here.

Data.Status will contain AwaitingAuthorisation because this consent has not been authorized by the user yet.
Data.ConsentId will contain the unique identifier assigned to your consent object. Save this, as you'll need it later.
Example Create Consent
curl -X POST \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/account-access-consents \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-abcdef123456' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "Data": {
    "Permissions": [
      "ReadAccountsBasic", "ReadTransactionsBasic", "ReadTransactionsDebits"
    ]},
    "Risk": {}}'
Example Create Consent Response
{
    "Data": {
        "Status": "AwaitingAuthorisation",
        "ConsentId": "123"
    }
}
3. User Flow

At the moment we are only supporting the browser redirect flow (Hybrid Flow) for authorizing the created consent.

The customer journey will start from the TPPs website from where a user action will trigger a redirect to the Wise Open Banking Authorization Endpoint

GET https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/openbanking/authorize

Parameter	Required	Description
response_type	Mandatory	code id_token
redirect_uri	Mandatory	One of the pre-registered redirect URIs
scope	Mandatory	Must include openid plus any requested scope
client_id	Mandatory	Pre-registered clientId of the TPP
request	Mandatory	JWT Request Object
state	Optional	If present, it must also be present in the JWT
nonce	Optional	If present, it must also be present in the JWT

You can take a look at the example JWT request object on the right. Please note that:

Every request parameter sent in the URL must also be present in the signed JWT.
The aud claim should be correctly filled as https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech
The openbanking_intent_id must be filled with a valid ConsentId issued to the TPP.
The JWT must be signed with a valid signing certificate.

Once the TPP redirects the user browser to the Authorization Endpoint the following things will happen in order:

User Login (use the username and password from the Test User Registration)
Pass 2FA challenge (User the code 111111 in sandbox)
Select profile you wish to give access to (Business or Personal)
Review and Authorize Consent
Redirect back to TPP

As part of the last step, the user browser is redirected to the TPP with the following parameters

Parameter	Required	Description
code	Mandatory	The authorization_code issued as the request of the request
id_token	Mandatory	Signed JWT containing details about the authorization
state	Optional	In case it was provided with the request

Note that in case the authorization request fails either because of a validation error on the request, or because the enduser drops off, we still redirect the user browser to the TPP with an error response of the following format:

Field	Description	Format
error	Error code according to RFC6749	Text
error_description	Detailed explanation of error	Text
Example Authorization Request
https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/openbanking/authorize?
  response_type=code%20id_token&
  redirect_uri=https://ob-dummy-tpp/redirect&
  scope=openid%20accounts&
  client_id=ob-dummy-tpp&
  state=state123&
  nonce=nonce123&
  request=eyJ0...sYjmjJg
Example Authorization JWT Response
{
  "kid": "er84c2cYa6dAe57BV3278Pf",
  "alg": "PS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
},
{
   "scope" : "openid accounts",
   "response_type" : "code id_token",
   "sub" : "user_id",
   "claims" : {
      "id_token" : {
         "openbanking_intent_id" : {
            "essential" : true,
            "value" : "123"
         },
         "acr" : {
            "values" : [
               "urn:openbanking:psd2:sca",
               "urn:openbanking:psd2:ca"
            ],
            "essential" : true
         }
      },
      "userinfo" : {
         "openbanking_intent_id" : {
            "value" : "123",
            "essential" : true
         }
      }
   },
   "iss" : "ob-dummy-tpp",
   "client_id" : "ob-dummy-tpp",
   "aud" : "https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech",
   "exp" : 2499287201,
   "iat" : 2499283601,
   "max_age" : 86400,
   "redirect_uri" : "https://ob-dummy-tpp/redirect"
}
4. Exchange Authorization Token

Once you get the authorization code after the browser redirect, you'll have to call the Token Endpoint to exchange this for a valid access token.

Request

POST https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token

Field	Description	Format
grant_type	OAuth Grant Type	authorization_code
redirect_uri	Pre-registered redirect Uri	URI
code	Authorization Code	Text
client_id	The client ID in accordance with RFC8705	Text
Response
Field	Description	Format
access_token	The access token	Text
expires_in	Access Token expiration time in seconds	Long
expires_at	Access Token expiration timestamp (UTC)	Text
scope	The scopes you have been given access to	Text
refresh_token	Refresh Token for refreshing access token	Text
refresh_token_expires_in	Refresh Token expiration time in seconds	Long
refresh_token_expires_at	Refresh Token expiration timestamp (UTC)	Text
Example Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token Request
curl -X POST \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fob-dummy-tpp%2Fredirect&code=abcdauthcode&client_id=ob-dummy-tpp'
Example Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token Response
{
    "access_token": "zzzzzzzz-1111-2222-3333-zzzzzzzzzzzz",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "refresh_token": "refreshr-efre-shre-fres-hrefreshrefr",
    "expires_in": 43199,
    "expires_at": "2025-04-11T03:43:28.148Z",
    "refresh_token_expires_in": 628639555,
    "refresh_token_expires_at": "2045-03-12T13:49:23.552Z",
    "scope": "accounts consent-id:123 openbanking openid"
}
5. Query the API

With the access-token from Authorization Code Flow used in the Authorization header, you'll be able to query the data endpoints.

Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx

Query API Request
curl -X GET \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/accounts \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer zzzzzzzz-1111-2222-3333-zzzzzzzzzzzz' \
Query API Response
{
    "Data": {
        "Account": [
            {
                "AccountId": "504",
                "Currency": "GBP",
                "AccountType": "Personal",
                "AccountSubType": "EMoney",
                "Account": [
                    {
                        "SchemeName": "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber",
                        "Identification": "230xxx1000xxxx",
                        "Name": "John Smith (GBP)"
                    }
                ],
                "Servicer": {
                    "SchemeName": "UK.OBIE.BICFI",
                    "Identification": "TRWIGB22"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
Token Endpoint

POST /open-banking/auth/token

The Token Endpoint supports the grant types: client_credentials, authorization_code and refresh_token. Every request made to the Token Endpoint should include the client_id request parameter as described by RFC6749, this helps us bind the client certificate used for the request with your client_id.

AISP Interfaces
Accounts

Querying the accounts endpoint will return all open currency accounts of the consented user.

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/accounts

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/accounts/{id}

Note: Not every multi-currency account opened in Wise has a unique set of local bank details attached to it. Therefore, it's expected that some of the currency accounts returned will have an empty OBReadAccount6/Data/Account/Account. We encourage AISPs to instead use the unique ID OBReadAccount6/Data/Account/AccountId for identifying different accounts. There's nothing inherently different between accounts with and without bank details, you can call the Balances and Transactions endpoints for either of them.

Balances

Querying the balances endpoint will return the current balance of each supported currency.

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/accounts/{id}/balances

Transactions

Querying the transactions endpoint will return a list of transactions similar to what the users see in their balance statements from within the consented time window. If the consent associated with the request is recent (less than 90 days old), we will allow requests to fetch transactions as old as you like. However, if the consent is older than 90 days, we will only allow requests to fetch transactions up to 90 days before the consent creation date, no matter what the requested or consented time frames are. This endpoint supports a query span of 450 days.

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/accounts/{id}/transactions

We are fully transparent about our transaction charges, so you will find fees attached to transactions in either of the following ways:

Embedded [DEFAULT]: Using the OBReadTransaction6/Data/Transaction/ChargeAmount object. Fees represented this way will be embedded into the transactions amount. This might make sense for most AISPs.
Fee Split : Showing fees as separate DEBIT transactions with an attached reference to the original transaction. Fees represented this way will not be embedded in the original transaction amount. This might make sense for some AISPs, like account software providers.

Migration Note: If you are migrating from 3.1, IDs of the transactions returned by the v3.1.11 version are different from the ones returned by the v3.1 version. However, you should be able to reconcile the vast majority of the new and old transactions simply by matching the Ids contained in the supplementaryData fields of each of them.

Direct Debits

Querying the direct debits endpoint will return the list of set up direct debits on a specific account

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/aisp/accounts/{id}/direct-debits

PISP Interfaces

Every consent object created for initiating payments will have a CutOffDateTime attached which is set to be 30 minutes after the creation of the consent. After the 30 minutes have lapsed, the Payment Order creation will be rejected.

We are supporting both UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber as well as UK.OBIE.IBAN for account identification.

At the moment we are only able to pass on a single reference to the debtor, which is Initiation/RemittanceInformation/Reference if present, or Initiation/EndToEndIdentification otherwise. The accepted size of the reference field varies based on the currency of the transfer. For EUR transfers you'll be able to leverage the full length of 35 characters of this field, however for GBP transfers this field length is restricted to a maximum of 18 characters. The reason for this restriction is also detailed in OB Payment Message Format Mapping. In case of FPS, this field gets mapped to both ISO8583 Field 62 as well as Field 120.

Domestic Payments

POST /open-banking/v3.1.11/pisp/domestic-payments

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/pisp/domestic-payments/{id}

The Domestic Payments endpoint can be used to initiate same currency transfers. You can initiate domestic payments in any of the supported currencies by Wise, assuming the consenting user already holds an open account in the requested currency.

International Payments

POST /open-banking/v3.1.11/pisp/international-payments

GET /open-banking/v3.1.11/pisp/international-payments/{id}

The International Payments endpoint can be used to initiate transfers where the source currency is different than the target currency. You can use it to initiate a payment with:

Fixed Source Amount : OBInternational3/InstructedAmount/Currency and OBInternational3/CurrencyOfTransfer are different.

The source currency and amount are specified using OBInternational3/InstructedAmount. The currency can be any of the supported currencies by Wise, assuming the consenting user already holds an open account in the requested currency.
The target currency of the transfer is specified using OBInternational3/CurrencyOfTransfer. The instructed amount will be converted to the CurrencyOfTransfer and sent out to the specified CreditorAccount.



Fixed Target Amount : OBInternational3/InstructedAmount/Currency and OBInternational3/CurrencyOfTransfer are the same.

The source currency of the transfer can either be specified using OBInternational3/ExchangeRateInformation/UnitCurrency, or it can be left unspecified, allowing the Wise customer to choose one of their eligible currency accounts during the authorization flow. The customer's choice of source currency, the exchange rate used, and any additional charges are clearly communicated to the customer as well as reflected to the TPP via the Payment Resource.
The target currency and amount are specified using OBInternational3/InstructedAmount.

We are only supporting INDICATIVE ExchangeRateInformation during the creation of the International Payment Consent. The real exchange rate used, along with any fees will be clearly communicated to the customer during the consent authorization, as well as reflected to the PISP during the creation of the International Payment Resource.

Updating Certificates

As part of regular maintenance or other special cases client certificates need to be changed from time to time. Depending on your integration type you might be able to do this in an automated or a manual way.

Open Banking Directory Participants
OBWAC/OBSeal certificates are automatically added to your JWKS resource endpoints and you should be able to use your new certificates automatically as soon as they get associated with your Software Statement in the Directory.
eIDAS certificates are treated similarly to OBWAC/OBSeal certificates as long as the issuing and root certificates haven't changed. If any certificate in your eIDAS trust chain has changed, you'll need to reach out to openbanking@wise.com for a manual update.
Other Participants

In case you're not an Open Banking Directory Participant we will only be able to update your certificates manually. Please reach out to openbanking@wise.com well ahead of your previous certificate becoming invalid to allow for enough time for our support team to handle your request.
