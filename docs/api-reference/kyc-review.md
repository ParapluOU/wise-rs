KYC Review
Copy

KYC Review API provides endpoints to view, update and submit information related to KYC flow. Partners redirect their customers in order to go through KYC requirements collection in a dynamic manner with minimal configurable styling if Hosted KYC is the preferred solution to provide KYC requirements.

Alternatively KYC Requirement Submit endpoint can be used for the KYC requirements that are allowed to be submitted. For the requirements that can't be submitted through this endpoint, partner should redirect their customer to Hosted KYC flow.

Please refer to our Hosted KYC guide for more information on the general use of the endpoints included below.
